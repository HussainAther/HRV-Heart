# ❤️ HRV-Heart

**HRV-Heart** is a web app that allows two people to sync their heartbeats in real time using webcam-based heart rate detection. Inspired by the science of heart rate variability (HRV) and emotional connection, this app visualizes two users' heartbeats merging into a synchronized rhythm. Perfect for Valentine's Day! 💖

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 **Webcam-based heartbeat detection** using PPG (Photoplethysmography)
- 🔄 **Real-time heartbeat syncing** between two users via Firebase/WebRTC
- 🎨 **Beautiful heart waveform visualization** that animates in sync
- 🌍 **Works on both desktop & mobile browsers**
- 🎉 **Easily shareable via GitHub Pages**

## 📌 How It Works
1. Place your **finger over your webcam** to detect your pulse.
2. Share the **sync link** with your partner.
3. Watch your heartbeats **visualize and sync together!**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** JavaScript (Vanilla JS / React)
- **Backend/Sync:** Firebase Firestore or WebRTC
- **Visualization:** HTML5 Canvas for heartbeat animation
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
